   News about Addressbook?

   Addressbook 0.7 has been released the 02.11.1997. In this version I merged
   contributions I received from users like support for more languages.

   What is Addressbook?

   Addressbook is a program to manage your addresses, phone numbers,
   e-mailaddresses and everything which is now written in your rolodex.
   Addressbook is copyrighted by [8]Clemens Durka, but available under the
   GNU GPL.

     What is needed to run Addressbook?

     Addressbook is based on Tcl/Tk, so you need a machine where Tcl/Tk is
     running. For most Unix like machines, Tcl/Tk is available. This program
     should run under any version from tcl7.3/tk3.6 to the actual version
     (tcl7.6 / tk4.2).

     This program is tested under:
   • Linux 1.2.13 (i586) Tcl7.3/Tk3.6 from Slackware 2.3
   • Linux 1.2.13 (i586) Tcl7.4/Tk4.0 from Slackware 3.0
   • Linux 2.0.29 (i586) Tcl7.6/Tk4.2 from Debian 1.3
   • HPUX 9.0x (HP 7xx)

     It is reported to work as well under:
   • HPUX 10.x (HP 7xx)
   • SunOS 4.x.x (Sun Sparc)
   • Solaris 2.4 (Sun Sparc)
   • OSF/1 3.0 (DEC Alpha)
   • AIX 3.2 (IBM Power Risc)
   • Irix 5.3 (SGI)

     Who else contributed to this package?

     Thanks to LEA (Lehrstuhl fuer Effiziente Algorithmen) of the Technical
     University of Munich and especially to Prof. Dr. E. Mayr. During a job,
     I do for them, I wrote this program.

     Thanks a lot to all the people who sended bug reports or made
     suggestions. Thanks especially to Andre Koster (scott@luna.nl) for the
     translation to dutch and to Stephen Mueller (stephen@sei.com) for
     testing and finding bugs. Thanks to Martin Paul
     (Martin.Paul@par.univie.ac.at) for contributing the mktable program for
     better printing. Thanks to all the translators for finnish (Jarmo
     Karvonen), swedish (Peter Antman) and italian (Andrea Borgia).
