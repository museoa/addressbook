                             Addressbook - Install

   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   1. Requirements

   To install Addressbook, you need:

   • A Computer
   • Tcl/Tk installed (tk3.6 or tk4.0 or newer)
   • The file addressbook-[version].tar.gz

     2. Unpacking

     Unpack the file addressbook-[version].tar.gz in your favorite place

 gzip -cd addressbook-[version].tar.gz | tar xvf -

     3. Testing

     If you want to test it before installing, just invoke
     './test_addressbook' and play with it.

     4. Installing

     4.1 Installation script

     I have provided an installation script written in tcl. You just have to
     invoke './install_addressbook' and answer the questions. If you want to
     install it as root, you have to be root while installing. If anything
     goes wrong, try to create the directories (for the binaries and the
     libdir) before starting the script. If nothing helps, you can always
     continue manually.

     4.2 Manual Installation

     You dont need this, if the install script finished without errors. Just
     if you have problems with the automatic installation, read on.

     You have to find out the location of the program 'wish' or 'wish4.0',
     the Tcl/Tk interpreter. Type something like 'where wish' or 'type wish'
     or 'type wish4.0' to get the full path to it.

     Replace (using your favorite editor) the first line of the file
     bin/addressbook if the path to wish on your system differs.

     Copy all the files in bin to /usr/local/bin, installing as root (or to
     ~/bin, installing as user)

 cp -d bin/* /usr/local/bin

     Make a directory /usr/local/lib/addressbook (or ~/addressbook) if you
     choose an other place, modify the variable 'configfile' in addressbook
     (about line 4)

     Copy all the files in lib (incl. subdirs) to /usr/local/lib/addressbook

 cp -dR lib/* /usr/local/lib/addressbook

     Edit (using your favorite editor) the file
     /usr/local/lib/addressbook/addressbook.config to meet your local needs.

     4.3. The little programs tel fax and email

     These programs are written in perl and they are standalone programs to
     get the telephone number in a fast way. They get installed by the
     installation program.

     5. Using

     To use, just call addressbook. You will get the default addressfile. If
     you want to create your own file, copy the formatfile from the default
     addressfile (/usr/local/lib/addressbook/addresses.dat.fmt) and modify
     it.

     Note: Each data file needs a format file with the same name plus the
     extension .fmt

     If you allow users to modify the global addressfile, you have to give
     them write access to the file. If not, every user should have a file
     .addressbook.config in his homedirectory pointing to his addressfile.

     With the file ~/.addressbook.config you can override the defaults.

     It is very handy to have a adrfile1 and adrfile2 defined in the global
     or privat config file, than you can switch easily between these two
     files for example for the global and personal addressbookfile.

     For the little programs, just invoke tel, email or fax with the name,
     you want to search as an argument.

     6. Registration

     Don't be shocked, the program is published under the GNU Public Licence
     (see COPYING). However, if you like the program and you use it
     regularly, it would be nice, if you would send me a short email, where
     you write what you like, what suggestions you have, how you were
     informed about the existence of this program, how many users use it and
     if you want to be notified, if a new version comes out. This
     registration doesn't cost anything, I will not use your email address
     for any purpose, unless you want to be notified of new versions. This
     registration helps me to track down the number of people who use it, the
     problems and the important things who need to be developed more.

     Use may use a form like this which you can find in the addressbook
     libdir as REGISTRATION and send it to the following address:
