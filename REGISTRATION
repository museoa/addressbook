Registration

Don't be shocked, the program is published under the GNU Public
Licence (see COPYING). However, if you like the program and you
use it regularly, it would be nice, if you would send me a short
email, where you write what you like, what suggestions you have,
how you were informed about the existence of this program,
how many users use it and if you want to be notified, if a new
version comes out. This registration doesn't cost anything, I
will not use your email address for any purpose, unless you want to
be notified of new versions. This registration helps me to track down
the number of people who use it, the problems and the important
things who need to be developed more.

Use may use a form like this which you can find in the addressbook
libdir as REGISTRATION and send it to the following address:

clemens@dagobah.de
