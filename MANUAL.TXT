  1. INVOKING ADDRESSBOOK

   To invoke addressbook, simply type addressbook. Then it will read the
   global configfile (normally /usr/local/lib/addressbook/addressbook.config)
   and, if you have, your private configfile (normally ~/.addressbook.config)
   to override some defaults.

   There are the following command line options:

 -a  or -addrfile         path and filename of the addressfile to load
 -c  or -configfile       path and filename of the configfile to load
 -lg or -language         language (english, german, french, dutch, italian)
 -ld or -libdir           path or the library directory
 -hlp                     show some help
 -l  or -lock             try to lock addressfile
 -ro                      open addressfile readonly and don't lock
 -db or -debug X          set debuglevel to X
 -iconic                  start as icon


   And the following environment variables:

 ADDRBOOK_LIBDIR          libdir         (same as -ld)
 ADDRBOOK_ADDRFILE        addressfile    (same as -a)
 ADDRBOOK_CONFIG          configfile     (same as -c)

   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  2. THE FIRST STEPS

   Once invoced, you should get a nice window with a menubar on the top, some
   entryfields left, a listbox with all the names in it right, and some
   buttons on the right and the bottom.

   Display address: Whenever you press the mouse button on a name in the
   listbox, you get the detailed address in the entryfield.

   Moving in the database: By pressing the buttons with the triangles you can
   move in the listbox. By pressing one of the buttons (A-Z) you jump
   directly to the corresponding letter. By typing some letters in the field
   beside the goto button, you jump to the name beginning with these letters.

   Searching: Press the leftmost button (Clear) to clear the entry field.
   Then fill in the fields, you want to search for. Then press the 'Search'
   button. The corresponding names will appear in the listbox. If you press
   the rightmost button (View) can toggle to see all names again.
   Example (with the exampledatabase): Press 'Clear', put the letter 'D' in
   the country field, press 'Search'. Now you will see all Germans.

   Delete a record: The button 'Delete Record' removes the record actually
   displayed.

   Add a record: Press 'Clear' to clear the entryfield. Complete the fields
   in the left part. Press 'Add record' to add the record. For the contents
   of the form, you should type in the data, please see the dataformat
   section in this manual. If you add several records which are similar in
   some fields, you can omit pressing 'Clear' and just change the fields,
   which are different before pressing 'Add record'. Attention: The record is
   only added in the database in the working application. You have to save
   changes to disk, before leaving the program.

   Change an existing record: Select the record you want to change, so that
   it is in the left field. Edit the fields you want to change. Press 'Change
   Record' and confirm. Changes get written to the file on the next saving.

   Saving changes to disk: Invoke File -> Save, if you want to save it with
   the same name, File -> Save as, if you want to change the name. If you
   call Save as, the dataformatfile gets copied automatically.

   Undo: The undo undoes the last add, delete and change operation.

   Loading another database: Invoke File -> Load and select the other
   database

   To exit the program: Invoke File -> Exit or press Ctrl+X. Dont forget to
   save before leaving, if you made some changes.

   To switch fast between two databases: Define adrfile1 and adrfile2 in your
   configfile, then you can switch fast between them.

   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  3. THE MENUBAR

   The File Menu:
   Load, Save, Save as, Close and Exit does what it should do :-)
   Print invokes printing, see unter printing.
   Import and is not implemented yet, sorry.
   If you defined adrfile1 and adrfile2 in your configfile, the names for
   these databases will appear below in the file menu. If you define
   adrfile1alias and adrfile2alias, those names will be displayed on the
   bottom of the filemenu instead of the filename. (Ex. adrfile2
   ~/.addresses.dat ; adrfile2alias "Privat Addresses")

   The Edit Menu:
   The same, than you can do with the buttons.

   The Goto Menu:
   The same, than you can do with the buttons.

   The Option Menu:

   Search options:

   exact search:
   the fields searched for must match exactly.

   wildcard search:
   search with wildcards like in the shell ('*','?','[]') (like: '*Main
   Street' 'Hauptstr.*' '[A-C]*')

   regexp search:
   Searches for regular Expressions
   Result to stdout: Switches the action for the buttons down right. Either
   they invoke a program or they write the corresponding data to stdout.
   Special characters: Defines what happens with non-ASCII characters. Either
   leave them and use ISO (recommended) or convert to TeX
   Change Preferences: Change Preferences: If you are to lasy to change the
   configfile by hand (see CONFIGFILE), you can change some things here.

   Countries:
   Here you can see all the country codes as you should use them.

   Help:
   Some help

   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  4. THE PHONE, FAX, MAIL AND EMAIL BUTTONS

   These buttons situated on the bottom right either put the contents of the
   corresponding field to stdout or they give them as argument to a program.
   Change the behavior with Options -> Result to stdout. The programs called
   are defined in the configfile, normally you can put there a program to
   dial, to compose a fax and send it, to write an e-mail and send it or to
   write an envelope with the printer. If you have a good program, which
   works, please write to the author.

   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  5. CREATE A NEW DATABASE

   Each database has a datafile and a formatfile. Normally the datafile ends
   with '.dat' and the formatfile with '.dat.fmt'. You have to create a
   dataformatfile and an empty datafile to begin a new database. So the
   easiest way to begin with a new database is to copy one of the sample
   dataformatfiles there where you want to have your addressfile. Or load an
   existing addressfile and use 'Save as' to save it to the new name (then
   the formatfile gets copied automatically). Then you can edit the
   formatfile.

   Ex.: You want to create a personal database in ~/adr which will have the
   name addresses.dat

   Create the directory:

 mkdir ~/adr

   Copy the sampledatafile to as addresses.dat.fmt to it:

 cp /usr/local/lib/addressbook/sample/addresses_private.dat.fmt \
     ~/adr/addresses.dat.fmt

   Modify the datafile to your needs (read the section DATAFORMATFILE)

 vi ~/adr/addresses.dat.fmt

   Create an empty datafile:

 touch ~/adr/adresses.dat

   Then invoke 'addressbook -a ~/adr/addresses.dat and you have your new
   empty database. Don't forget to save before quitting.

   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  6. DATAFORMAT

   The Format, data is stored is quite simple:

   one file (usually with extension .dat) holds all the data, one line per
   entry, fields separated by a special character (usually ';')

   a second file (extension .dat.fmt) holds the format definitions, that
   means, which field contains which data, which fields get shown in the
   listbox and which format.

   The program fully supports 8 bit iso-latin fonts, so enter any special
   character just like this. (german umlauts, french accents). If these
   special characters are on your keyboard, but don't work, you maybe need to
   modify Xmodmap.

   Format for some fields:

 addon           something like c/o which doesn't belong to street

 street          just as usual in the country: first streetname and number or
                 first number, then streetname (like in France)

 country         Please use country abbrevations as on international number
                 plates. By clicking on the Button Countries you get a list.
                 Full names will be expanded automatically.

 zip             Zip Code, including state (for USA) or letters (for NL)

 city            City name without zipcode

 birthday        feel free, but consequent. I use dd.mm.yyyy
                 maybe sometime a 'birthday reminder app' will be added

 phone*          IMPORTANT: put it, as if you were already in the country
                 international dial prefixes are added automatically, if
                 your configuration in addressbook.config is correct.
                 p.ex.:
                 1-234-567-7890 (USA & Canada)
                 (089)1234567   (Germany and many others)
                 12345678       (Danmark and France exept Paris)
                 (1)44556677    (France around Paris)

 email           full email address

   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  7. CONFIGFILE

   You can change much of the behavior of the program in the configfile. Most
   of the options have resonable defaults, so you don't need them. All of
   these can be overwritten with the global and personal configfile. First
   the global one is loaded and then it is overwritten by your personal one.
   You can look in libdir/addressbook.config.sample for some ideas.

   The following options should be set by the installation, but you can
   change them:

 libdir          path to the librarydirectory (the only really important thing)
 adrfile         the default addressfile
 language        the default language (english, german, french)
 mycountry       the countrycode of your country (p.ex. USA or CDN or D)
 myareacode      your telephone area code (for correct omission for local calls)
                 including the 1 for USA (like 1212 for New York,
                 089 for M�nchen, 1 for Paris)

   These options you have to change manually, if you need:

 dialoutlocal    Your dialoutprefix for local calls inside your telephone
                 installation. If you have a standalone phone, it sould be empty
 dialoutdistance Your dialoutprefix for long distance calls inside your
                 tel. installation
 callprog,phone  Program which is called to dial a phone number
                 (use %number for number)
 callprog,fax    Proger for emailaddress)
 only_stdout     Actionbuttons only put to stdout (instead of calling
                 upper programs)
 searchtype      The default searchtype (exact, match, regexp)
 select_mask     The selection mask for filenames (endings of datafiles)
 texconvert      Conversion to TeX

 confirm         Confirm each add and change operation (default no)
 confirmdelete   Confirm delete operation (default yes)

 makebackup      Always create a backupcopy when saving (default yes)
 removetmp       Remove temporary files (default yes)
 lockbydefault   Try to lock file and so that the first person gets
                 write access and all other persons at the same time
                 only read access.
 nolocking       Don't do file locking (for security reasons, this can
                 only be specified in the global configfile, not in the
                 personal one.)
 color           The color used: old for yellow, new for grey or anything
                 that is accepted by tk_palette (default old)
 defaultfont     some fonts
 entryfont
 titlefont
 fixedfont
 showabcbuttons  Show ABC Buttons (default yes)
 showactionbuttons       Show Action Buttons (default yes)

 userhead        Userdefined LaTeX heading (default \\documentclass{article}
                 \\begin{document} \\begin{tabular})
 usertail        Uderdefined LaTeX end (default \\end{tabular} \\end{document})
 userincludecolumns  set to yes, if you specify the number of colums of the
                 LaTeX table. (default no, then '{lllll...}' is added correctly)
 usercalllatex   LaTeX is called from the programm (default yes)


   Printing related options (some thing might not work, as printing is in
   development). In parentheses possible settings, default is the first one.

 printform       Default form and fields to print (address, name,
                 nametel, addresstel, almostever, everything)
 printopt        Default print output (latex, text, ascii, ps)
 printtype       Print as (line, box)
 printarea       Area to print (all, selection, region)
 printfile       File in which to print (use '| lpr' to send to printer)
 print,name      The fields to print when printform is name.
 print,nametel   same (as well for address, addresstel, almostever, everything
                 Entries which belog together are in curly braces {}
 zipformat,eu    Format for the order of zip and city (Europe = state zip city)
 zipformat,uk    Format for the order of zip and city (UK   = city state zip)
 zipformat,us    Format for the order of zip and city (USA  = city, state zip;
                 which is written as ", city state zip"

   These options normally should not needed to be changed, they have
   hardcoded defaults, so you neednot mention them in your configfile:

 entrywidth      width of the entryfields
 listboxwidth    width of the listbox
 listboxheight   height of the listbox

   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  8. DATAFORMATFILE

   The dataformatfile defines the semantic of the datafile. Each field of the
   database has to be identified by a contents type. There are many
   predefined types, but you can define yourself some new ones. This is
   needed, so that the program can identify special fields, like the country
   or the phonenumber and for selection to print.

   In the dataformatfile, you have to write in each line the number of the
   field (beginning with 0) and the type.

   For example:

 0 firstname
 1 lastname
 2 phonepriv
 3 phonework
 4 other1

   If you define your own type (other1 - other9) you have to supply a label
   (label1 - label9 for it)

 label1 "Special purpose field"

   Some other things in the dataformatfile:

 separatorchar   (you should use ';' unless you have important reasons)
 listboxformat   ("%s %s" or "%s, %s", depending if you want a comma between
                 the fields. (like Firstname Lastname or Lastname, Firstname)
 listboxentry1   The 1st field in the listbox
 listboxentry2   The 2nd field in the listbox
 sort1           The 1st field the listbox is sorted
 sort2           The 2nd field for sorting


   Note: Sorting is not done while loading, only when loading or changing a
   record.

   Following types for fields are possibe:

 Field-ID              german transl.          french transl.

 other7                zu definieren           a definer
 other8                zu definieren           a definer
 other9                zu definieren           a definer

   If you define your own fields and you want to print them, you have to
   modify print,address and similar in the optionfile. Every predefined field
   can be used a second time if you add a '2' so you can have street and
   street2.

   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  9. THE LITTLE PROGRAMMS TEL, FAX AND EMAIL

   Just call these programs with the name, you want to look for as argument,
   like 'tel Pumuckl'. If it doesn't work, maybe you have to adjust the
   variables $CONFIGFILE inside the program.

   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  10. PRINTING

   Printing is under development, so it works only partially. If you want to
   send the files directly to the printer, you have to set the printfilename
   so something like '| lpr'. If you want to modify the texfiles before
   printing, set removetmp to NO in the configfile.

   Thanks to Martin Paul <Martin.Paul@par.univie.ac.at>. He contributed a
   standalone program for better printing. It is in the contrib directory and
   it includes enough documentation and examples. For the moment this is
   probably the best option to print until I find time to integrate it in the
   program.

   If you want to use the builtin printing you can modify the fields which
   are printed in the config file. The related options are print,name
   print,nametel print,address and so on. For example if you define
   print,nametel {{title firstname lastname} {phone , phonepriv , phonework ,
   fax}} You will get two lines of output, the first with the names separated
   by space and the second with the phonenumbers separated by , In future I
   might change these definitions to the ones used by Martin Paul.
