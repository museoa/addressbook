These are things which are left to do.
Any help is appreciated. I'll probably continue to develop, but
I don't know, how much time I can spend for it.

Short term:

File -> Lock and File -> Unlock
Choose locking state when loading a file
Modification date which gets updated automatically
Ctrl+M doesn't work but I couldn't find the problem
Check for 'dead' lockfile on startup

Long term:

Printing ... 
 - printing of addresslists
 - printing of only special fields
 - printing of enveloppes
 - printing directly in postscript wish the canvas widget
   (started but not finished)
Translation to spanish, italian, swedish, norwegian or whatever
Possibility to send email to all people of a selection
International sorting including german umlauts and french accents
More user definable buttons
Types for the entryfields to allow several dateformats, more than one
  line entries and pictures
Editor for the formatfile to change fields and adjust data in it
Change in the user interface to avoid confusion with the clear button
